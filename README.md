# I Like Turtles

## Introduction

I created this small project because I wanted create a possibility to teach programming to beginner programmers with a visual experience. The Problem I wanted to solve is that beginner programmers should be able to write logic without worrying about the confusing GUI stuff.
*I Like Turtles* is an educational tool designed to teach programming concepts through fun and interactive exercises.

## How to Use

To use *I Like Turtles*, simply run the main.py file in your terminal. The application will launch with a GUI that displays a list of programming exercises. To run an exercise, simply click on its label on the left side of the screen. The corresponding turtle graphics will be displayed on the right side of the screen. If you would like to save the output of an exercise, simply click the "Save" button located at the top right of the screen. The exercise will be saved as a PNG image with the name of the exercise and the date and time it was saved.
